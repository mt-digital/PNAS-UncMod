  abstract =      {Unlike other animal species, much of the variation
                   among human groups is cultural: genetically similar
                   people living in similar environments exhibit
                   strikingly different patterns of behavior because
                   they have different, culturally acquired beliefs and
                   values. Such cultural transmission is based on
                   complex, derived psychological mechanisms that are
                   likely to have been shaped by natural selection. It
                   is important to understand the nature of these
                   evolved psychological mechanisms because they
                   determine which beliefs and values spread and persist
                   in human groups. Boyd and Richerson showed that a
                   tendency to acquire the most common behavior
                   exhibited in a society was adaptive in a simple model
                   of evolution in a spatially varying environment,
                   because such a tendency increases the probability of
                   acquiring adaptive beliefs and values. Here, we study
                   the evolution of such "conformist transmission" in a
                   more general model in which environments vary in both
                   time and space. The analysis of this model indicates
                   that conformist transmission is favored under a very
                   broad range of conditions, broader in fact than the
                   range of conditions that favor a substantial reliance
                   on social learning. The analysis also suggests that
                   there is a synergistic relationship between the
                   evolution of imitation and the evolution of
                   conformism. We conclude by examining the role of
                   conformism in explaining the maintenance of cultural
                   differences among groups. {\textcopyright} 1998

                   behavior from others. These strategies themselves are
                   partly products of natural selection, making the
                   study of social learning an inherently Darwinian
                   project. Formal models of the evolution of social
                   learning suggest that reliance on social learning
                   should increase with task difficulty and decrease
                   with the probability of environmental change. These
                   models also make predictions about how individuals
                   integrate information from multiple peers. We present
                   the results of microsociety experiments designed to
                   evaluate these predictions. The first experiment
                   measures baseline individual learning strategy in a
                   two-armed bandit environment with variation in task
                   difficulty and temporal fluctuation in the payoffs of
                   the options. Our second experiment addresses how
                   people in the same environment use minimal social
                   information from a single peer. Our third experiment
                   expands on the second by allowing access to the
                   behavior of several other individuals, permitting
                   frequency-dependent strategies like conformity. In
                   each of these experiments, we vary task difficulty
                   and environmental fluctuation. We present several
                   candidate strategies and compute the expected payoffs
                   to each in our experimental environment. We then fit
                   to the data the different models of the use of social
                   information and identify the best-fitting model via
                   model comparison techniques. We find substantial
                   evidence of both conformist and nonconformist social
                   learning and compare our results to theoretical
                   expectations. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All

                   copying of others is rarely beneficial. Theory
                   suggests that individuals should be selective in
                   what, when, and whom they copy, by following 'social
                   learning strategies' (SLSs). The SLS concept has

                   to the social learning and cultural evolution fields.
                   However, the SLS concept needs updating to
                   accommodate recent findings that individuals switch
                   between strategies flexibly, that multiple strategies
                   are deployed simultaneously, and that there is no

                   agents, and who they should copy. Behavioural
                   ecologists and economists have discovered an
                   impressive range of SLSs, and explored their likely
                   impact on behavioural efficiency and reproductive

                   the nature and origins of the cognitive processes

                   ‘blackboxing' of SLSs is no longer a viable
                   scientific strategy. It has contributed, through the
                   ‘social learning strategies tournament', to the
                   premature conclusion that social learning is
                   generally better than asocial learning, and to a deep
                   puzzle about the relationship between SLSs and
                   cultural evolution. The puzzle can be solved by
                   recognizing that whereas most SLSs are
                   ‘planetary'—they depend on domain-general
                   cognitive processes—some SLSs, found only in
                   humans, are ‘cook-like'—they depend on explicit,
                   metacognitive rules, such as copy digital natives.
                   These metacognitive SLSs contribute to cultural
                   evolution by fostering the development of processes
                   that enhance the exclusivity, specificity, and
                   accuracy of social learning.},

                   humanity, yet it remains unclear why copying is
                   profitable and how to copy most effectively. To
                   address these questions, we organized a computer
                   tournament in which entrants submitted strategies
                   specifying how to use social learning and its asocial
                   alternative (for example, trial-andor learning) to
                   acquire adaptive behavior in a complex environment.
                   Most current theory predicts the emergence of mixed
                   strategies that rely on some combination of the two
                   types of learning. In the tournament, however,
                   strategies that relied heavily on social learning
                   were found to be remarkably successful, even when
                   asocial information was no more costly than social
                   information. Social learning proved advantageous
                   because individuals frequently demonstrated the
                   highest-payoff behavior in their repertoire,
                   inadvertently filtering information for copiers. The

                   deal with the fact that available models may exhibit
                   different behaviors, and how social and individual

  abstract =      {Social learning (learning from others) is
                   evolutionarily adaptive under a wide range of
                   conditions and is a long-standing area of interest
                   across the social and biological sciences. One
                   social-learning mechanism derived from cultural
                   evolutionary theory is prestige bias, which allows a
                   learner in a novel environment to quickly and
                   inexpensively gather information as to the
                   potentially best teachers, thus maximizing his or her
                   chances of acquiring adaptive behavior. Learners
                   provide deference to high-status individuals in order
                   to ingratiate themselves with, and gain extended
                   exposure to, that individual. We examined
                   prestige-biased social transmission in a laboratory
                   experiment in which participants designed arrowheads
                   and attempted to maximize hunting success, measured
                   in caloric return. Our main findings are that (1)
                   participants preferentially learned from prestigious
                   models (defined as those models at whom others spent
                   longer times looking), and (2) prestige information
                   and success-related information were used to the same
                   degree, even though the former was less useful in
                   this experiment than the latter. We also found that
                   (3) participants were most likely to use social
                   learning over individual (asocial) learning when they
                   were performing poorly, in line with previous
                   experiments, and (4) prestige information was not
                   used more often following environmental shifts,
                   contrary to predictions. These results support
                   previous discussions of the key role that
                   prestige-biased transmission plays in social
                   learning.},

  abstract =      {Copying others appears to be a cost-effective way of
                   obtaining adaptive information, particularly when
                   flexibly employed. However, adult humans differ
                   considerably in their propensity to use information
                   from others, even when this 'social information' is
                   beneficial, raising the possibility that stable
                   individual differences constrain flexibility in
                   social information use. We used two dissimilar
                   decision-making computer games to investigate whether
                   individuals flexibly adjusted their use of social
                   information to current conditions or whether they
                   valued social information similarly in both games.
                   Participants also completed established personality
                   questionnaires. We found that participants
                   demonstrated considerable flexibility, adjusting
                   social information use to current conditions. In
                   particular, individuals employed a
                   'copy-when-uncertain' social learning strategy,
                   supporting a core, but untested, assumption of
                   influential theoretical models of cultural
                   transmission. Moreover, participants adjusted the
                   amount invested in their decision based on the
                   perceived reliability of personally gathered
                   information combined with the available social
                   information. However, despite this strategic
                   flexibility, participants also exhibited consistent
                   individual differences in their propensities to use
                   and value social information. Moreover, individuals
                   who favoured social information selfreported as more
                   collectivist than others. We discuss the implications
                   of our results for social information use and
                   cultural transmission. {\textcopyright} 2013 The

                   rely on social learning over individual learning and
                   the relative strength of their conformist social
                   learning biases. Here we use both treatment effects
                   and individual variation to test predictions about
                   the impact of (1) the number of traits in an
                   environment, (2) the adaptive or payoff relevance of
                   those traits, (3) the fidelity of transmission, and
                   (4) the size of groups. We find that both social
                   learning and the strength of conformist transmission
                   increase with the number of traits, the adaptive
                   value of those traits, and the fidelity of
                   transmission. The strength of conformist transmission
                   increases with group size, but only when there were 2
                   traits in the environment. Using individual-level
                   variation and recognizing that treatment effects
                   predictably impact individuals differently, we show
                   that IQ negatively predicts social learning, but has
                   a U-shaped relationship to conformist transmission,
                   suggesting strategic use of conformist-biased social
                   learning among those with the highest IQ. Other
                   plausible predictors, such as status, cultural
                   background, and personality, were not predictive.
                   Broadly, our results reveal that not only is the
                   conformist transmission bias ubiquitous, but that
                   past experiments, both human and non-human, have
                   likely underestimated its prevalence and the
                   prevalence of social learning by restricting designs
                   to only 2 traits.},

  abstract =      {The idea of adaptation, in which an organism or
                   population becomes better suited to its environment,
                   is used in a variety of disciplines. Originating in
                   evolutionary biology, adaptation has been a central
                   theme in biological anthropology and human ecology.
                   More recently, the study of adaptation in the context
                   of climate change has become an important topic of
                   research in the social sciences. While there are
                   clearly commonalities in the different uses of the
                   concept of adaptation in these fields, there are also
                   substantial differences. We describe these
                   differences and suggest that the study of
                   climate-change adaptation could benefit from a
                   re-integration with biological and evolutionary
                   conceptions of human adaptation. This integration
                   would allow us to employ the substantial theoretical
                   tools of evolutionary biology and anthropology to
                   understand what promotes or impedes adaptation. The
                   evolutionary perspective on adaptation focuses on
                   diversity because diversity drives adaptive
                   evolution. Population structures are also critical in
                   facilitating or preventing adaptation to local
                   environmental conditions. This suggests that
                   climate-change adaptation should focus on the sources
                   of innovation and social structures that nurture
                   innovations and allow them to spread. Truly
                   innovative ideas are likely to arise on the periphery
                   of cohesive social groups and spread inward. The
                   evolutionary perspective also suggests that we pay
                   careful attention to correlated traits, which can
                   distort adaptive trajectories, as well as to the
                   importance of risk management in adaptations to
                   variable or uncertain environments. Finally, we
                   suggest that climate-change adaptation could benefit
                   from a broader study of how local groups adapt to
                   their dynamic environments, a process we call
                   “autochthonous adaptation.”.},
