abstract = {     Disease transmission and behaviour change are both fundamentally social phenomena. Behaviour change can have profound consequences for disease transmission, and epidemic conditions can favour the more rapid adoption of behavioural innovations. We analyse a simple model of coupled behaviour change and infection in a structured population characterised by homophily and outgroup aversion. Outgroup aversion slows the rate of adoption and can lead to lower rates of adoption in the later-adopting group or even behavioural divergence between groups when outgroup aversion exceeds positive ingroup influence. When disease dynamics are coupled to the behaviour-adoption model, a wide variety of outcomes are possible. Homophily can either increase or decrease the final size of the epidemic depending on its relative strength in the two groups and on R 0 for the infection. For example, if the first group is homophilous and the second is not, the second group will have a larger epidemic. Homophily and outgroup aversion can also produce dynamics suggestive of a ‘second wave' in the first group that follows the peak of the epidemic in the second group. Our simple model reveals dynamics that are suggestive of the processes currently observed under pandemic conditions in culturally and/or politically polarised populations such as the USA. },

Here we evaluate the performance of 32 community-based adaptation initiatives across 20 rural communities in the Pacific. We find that initiative appropriateness was a strength while sustainability was a consistent issue, locally funded initiatives and those implemented by non-governmental organizations were more likely to perform better, and climate awareness-raising initiatives and those integrated with ecosystem-based adaptation performed best. We also identify four multidimensional and interdependent optimization points for future community-based adaptation initiatives: local approval and ownership, shared access to and benefit from initiatives, integration of local realities, and systems-thinking and forward planning. Our analysis suggests the need for a praxis shift whereby adaptation is locally led, communities drive their own agendas, and donors and implementers become facilitators that resource the diverse capacities of communities and help achieve local objectives equitably.},

abstract = {Most research on decision making has focused on how human or animal decision makers choose between two or more options, posed in advance by the researchers. The mechanisms by which options are generated for most decisions, however, are not well understood. Models of sequential search have examined the trade-off between continued exploration and choosing one's current best option, but still cannot explain the processes by which new options are generated. We argue that understanding the origins of options is a crucial but untapped area for decision making research. We explore a number of factors which influence the generation of options, which fall broadly into two categories: psycho-biological and socio-cultural. The former category includes factors such as perceptual biases and associative memory networks. The latter category relies on the incredible human capacity for culture and social learning, which doubtless shape not only our choices but the options available for choice. Our intention is to start a discussion that brings us closer toward understanding the origins of options. {\textcopyright} 2012 Smaldino and Richerson.},

abstract = {How do humans search for rewards? This question is commonly studied using multi-armed bandit tasks, which require participants to trade off exploration and exploitation. Standard multi-armed bandits assume that each option has an independent reward distribution. However, learning about options independently is unrealistic, since in the real world options often share an underlying structure. We study a class of structured bandit tasks, which we use to probe how generalization guides exploration. In a structured multi-armed bandit, options have a correlation structure dictated by a latent function. We focus on bandits in which rewards are linear functions of an option's spatial position. Across 5 experiments, we find evidence that participants utilize functional structure to guide their exploration, and also exhibit a learning-to-learn effect across rounds, becoming progressively faster at identifying the latent function. Our experiments rule out several heuristic explanations and show that the same findings obtain with non-linear functions. Comparing several models of learning and decision making, we find that the best model of human behavior in our tasks combines three computational mechanisms: (1) function learning, (2) clustering of reward distributions across rounds, and (3) uncertainty-guided exploration. Our results suggest that human reinforcement learning can utilize latent structure in sophisticated ways to improve efficiency.},

abstract = {How does time pressure influence exploration and decision-making? We investigated this question with several four-armed bandit tasks manipulating (within subjects) expected reward, uncertainty, and time pressure (limited vs. unlimited). With limited time, people have less opportunity to perform costly computations, thus shifting the cost-benefit balance of different exploration strategies. Through behavioral, reinforcement learning (RL), reaction time (RT), and evidence accumulation analyses, we show that time pressure changes how people explore and respond to uncertainty. Specifically, participants reduced their uncertainty-directed exploration under time pressure, were less value-directed, and repeated choices more often. Since our analyses relate uncertainty to slower responses and dampened evidence accumulation (i.e., drift rates), this demonstrates a resource-rational shift towards simpler, lower-cost strategies under time pressure. These results shed light on how people adapt their exploration and decision-making strategies to externally imposed cognitive constraints.},

When agents' beliefs or behaviors are developed by aver- aging what they see among their neighbors, then convergence to a consensus is slowed by the presence of homophily but is not influenced by network density (in contrast to other network processes that depend on shortest paths). In deriving these results, we propose a new, general measure of homophily based on the relative frequencies of interactions among different groups.

@article{Henrich2004,
abstract = {A combination of archeological and ethnohistorical evidence indicates that, over an approximately 8,000-year period, from the beginning of the Holocene until European explorers began arriving in the eighteenth century, the societies of Tasmania lost a series of valuable skills and technologies. These likely included bone tools, cold-weather clothing, hafted tools, nets, fishing spears, barbed spears, spear-throwers, and boomerangs. To address this puzzle, and the more general question of how human cognition and social interaction can generate both adaptive cultural evolution and maladaptive losses of cul-turally acquired skills, this paper constructs a formal model of cultural evolution rooted in the cognitive details of human social learning and inference. The analytical results specify the conditions for differing rates of adaptive cultural evolu-tion, and reveal regimes that will produce maladaptive losses of particular kinds of skills and related technologies. More specifically, the results suggest that the relatively sudden reduction in the effective population size (the size of the interact-ing pool of social learners) that occurred with the rising ocean levels at the end of the last glacial epoch, which cut Tas-mania off from the rest of Australia for the ensuing ten millennia, could have initiated a cultural evolutionary process that (1) kept stable or even improved relatively simple technological skills, and (2) produced an increasing deterioration of more complex skills leading to the complete disappearance of some technologies and practices. This pattern is consistent with the empirical record in Tasmania. Beyond this case, I speculate on the applicability of the model to understanding the vari-ability in rates of adaptive cultural evolution. La evidencia arqueoldgica y etnohist6rica indica que, a lo largo de aproximadamente 8, 000 afios, desde el principio del Holo-ceno hasta la llegada de exploradores europeos en el siglo XVIII, las sociedades de Tasmania perdieron gran parte de su cul-tura tecnolo'gica. Las herramientas que desaparecieron probablemente incluyen el hueso, ropa resistente alfrio, los instrumentos enmangados, arpones, lanzas de pdas, los lanza-lanzadores y los bumerangs. g Cdmo es posible que se perdiera todo esto? Para resolver este misterio, y tambidn esclarecer deforma mds general c6mo el conocimiento humano y la interaccidn social pueden generar adaptaciones y tambidn la pe'rdida de las mismas, e inclusive malas adaptaciones, en este articulo se con-struye un modelo formal de la evolucidn cultural que se basa en detalles cognoscitivos del aprendizaje y la inferencia humanos en el dmbito social.

abstract = {The present study examined basic assumptions embedded in learning models for predicting behavior in decisions based on experience. In such decisions, the probabilities and payoffs are initially unknown and are learned from repeated choice with payoff feedback. We examined combinations of two rules for updating past experience with new payoff feedback and of two choice rule assumptions for mapping experience onto choices. The combination of these assumptions produced four classes of models that were systematically compared. Two methods were employed to evaluate the success of learning models for approximating players' choices: One was based on estimating parameters from each person's data to maximize the prediction of choices one step ahead, conditioned by the observed past history of feedback. The second was based on making a priori predictions for the entire sequence of choices using parameters estimated from a separate experiment. The results indicated the advantage of a class of models incorporating decay of previous experience, whereas the ranking of choice rules depended on the evaluation method used.

@article{Daw2006,
abstract = {Decision making in an uncertain environment poses a conflict between the opposing demands of gathering and exploiting information. In a classic illustration of this 'exploration-exploitation' dilemma, a gambler choosing between multiple slot machines balances the desire to select what seems, on the basis of accumulated experience, the richest option, against the desire to choose a less familiar option that might turn out more advantageous (and thereby provide information for improving future decisions). Far from representing idle curiosity, such exploration is often critical for organisms to discover how best to harvest resources such as food and water. In appetitive choice, substantial experimental evidence, underpinned by computational reinforcement learning (RL) theory, indicates that a dopaminergic, striatal and medial prefrontal network mediates learning to exploit. In contrast, although exploration has been well studied from both theoretical and ethological perspectives, its neural substrates are much less clear. Here we show, in a gambling task, that human subjects' choices can be characterized by a computationally well-regarded strategy for addressing the explore/exploit dilemma. Furthermore, using this characterization to classify decisions as exploratory or exploitative, we employ functional magnetic resonance imaging to show that the frontopolar cortex and intraparietal sulcus are preferentially active during exploratory decisions. In contrast, regions of striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex exhibit activity characteristic of an involvement in value-based exploitative decision making. The results suggest a model of action selection under uncertainty that involves switching between exploratory and exploitative behavioural modes, and provide a computationally precise characterization of the contribution of key decision-related brain systems to each of these functions. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

Here we present a novel algorithmic model expanding the classical actor-critic architecture to include fundamental interactive properties of neural circuit models, incorporating both incentive and learning effects into a single theoretical framework. The standard actor is replaced by a dual opponent actor system representing distinct striatal populations, which come to differentially specialize in discriminating positive and negative action values. Dopamine modulates the degree to which each actor component contributes to both learning and choice discriminations. In contrast to standard frameworks, this model simultaneously captures documented effects of dopamine on both learning and choice incentive—and their interac- tions—across a variety of studies, including probabilistic RL, effort-based choice, and motor skill learning.},

We use a simple model to investigate how populations negotiate the trade-off between acquiring new skills and getting better at existing skills and how this trade-off shapes social networks. We find unexpected eco-evolutionary feedbacks from culture onto social networks and vice versa. We show that selecting for skill generalists results in sparse networks with diverse skill sets, whereas selecting for skill specialists results in dense networks and a population that specializes on the same few skills on which everyone is an expert.

abstract = {This paper aims to examine the evolutionary role of affordances, that is, the possibilities for action available in our environments. There are two allegedly competing views for explaining the evolutionary role of affordances: the first is based on natural selection; the second is based on niche construction. According to the first, affordances are resources that exert selection pressure. The second view claims that affordances are ecological inheritances in the organism's niche that are the product of a previous alteration of the environment. While there seems to be a mutually exclusive definition of affordances in each of these views, I argue in this paper that the views are not competing but, rather, complementary. In this sense, affordances play the role of either resources or ecological inheritances depending on the temporal stage of the evolutionary process. I make this argument by analyzing how natural selection and niche construction affect each other even when they function independently from each other. In this light, if these two evolutionary mechanisms exert their power in parallel but at two different stages in the evolutionary history of a given econiche, then there is room to claim that affordances can be understood as both resources and ecological inheritances. This dual aspect of affordances shows their evolutionary role.},

abstract = {The structure of social interactions influences many aspects of social life, including the spread of information and behavior, and the evolution of social phenotypes. After dispersal, organisms move around throughout their lives, and the patterns of their movement influence their social encounters over the course of their lifespan. Though both space and mobility are known to influence social evolution, there is little analysis of the influence of specific movement patterns on evolutionary dynamics. We explored the effects of random movement strategies on the evolution of cooperation using an agent-based prisoner's dilemma model with mobile agents. This is the first systematic analysis of a model in which cooperators and defectors can use different random movement strategies, which we chose to fall on a spectrum between highly exploratory and highly restricted in their search tendencies. Because limited dispersal and restrictions to local neighborhood size are known to influence the ability of cooperators to effectively assort, we also assessed the robustness of our findings with respect to dispersal and local capacity constraints. We show that differences in patterns of movement can dramatically influence the likelihood of cooperator success, and that the effects of different movement patterns are sensitive to environmental assumptions about offspring dispersal and local space constraints. Since local interactions implicitly generate dynamic social interaction networks, we also measured the average number of unique and total interactions over a lifetime and considered how these emergent network dynamics helped explain the results. This work extends what is known about mobility and the evolution of cooperation, and also has general implications for social models with randomly moving agents. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

                   among human groups is cultural: genetically similar
                   people living in similar environments exhibit
                   strikingly different patterns of behavior because
                   they have different, culturally acquired beliefs and
                   values. Such cultural transmission is based on
                   complex, derived psychological mechanisms that are
                   likely to have been shaped by natural selection. It
                   is important to understand the nature of these
                   evolved psychological mechanisms because they
                   determine which beliefs and values spread and persist
                   in human groups. Boyd and Richerson showed that a
                   tendency to acquire the most common behavior
                   exhibited in a society was adaptive in a simple model
                   of evolution in a spatially varying environment,
                   because such a tendency increases the probability of
                   acquiring adaptive beliefs and values. Here, we study
                   the evolution of such "conformist transmission" in a
                   more general model in which environments vary in both
                   time and space. The analysis of this model indicates
                   that conformist transmission is favored under a very
                   broad range of conditions, broader in fact than the
                   range of conditions that favor a substantial reliance
                   on social learning. The analysis also suggests that
                   there is a synergistic relationship between the
                   evolution of imitation and the evolution of
                   conformism. We conclude by examining the role of
                   conformism in explaining the maintenance of cultural
                   differences among groups. {\textcopyright} 1998

                   strategies that individuals employ to acquire
                   behavior from others. These strategies themselves are
                   partly products of natural selection, making the
                   study of social learning an inherently Darwinian
                   project. Formal models of the evolution of social
                   learning suggest that reliance on social learning
                   should increase with task difficulty and decrease
                   with the probability of environmental change. These
                   models also make predictions about how individuals
                   integrate information from multiple peers. We present
                   the results of microsociety experiments designed to
                   evaluate these predictions. The first experiment
                   measures baseline individual learning strategy in a
                   two-armed bandit environment with variation in task
                   difficulty and temporal fluctuation in the payoffs of
                   the options. Our second experiment addresses how
                   people in the same environment use minimal social
                   information from a single peer. Our third experiment
                   expands on the second by allowing access to the
                   behavior of several other individuals, permitting
                   frequency-dependent strategies like conformity. In
                   each of these experiments, we vary task difficulty
                   and environmental fluctuation. We present several
                   candidate strategies and compute the expected payoffs
                   to each in our experimental environment. We then fit
                   to the data the different models of the use of social
                   information and identify the best-fitting model via
                   model comparison techniques. We find substantial
                   evidence of both conformist and nonconformist social
                   learning and compare our results to theoretical
                   expectations. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All

                   suggests that individuals should be selective in

                   accommodate recent findings that individuals switch

                   believed. Recent research has expanded the list to

  abstract =      {The idea of adaptation, in which an organism or
                   population becomes better suited to its environment,
                   is used in a variety of disciplines. Originating in
                   evolutionary biology, adaptation has been a central
                   theme in biological anthropology and human ecology.
                   More recently, the study of adaptation in the context
                   of climate change has become an important topic of
                   research in the social sciences. While there are
                   clearly commonalities in the different uses of the
                   concept of adaptation in these fields, there are also
                   substantial differences. We describe these
                   differences and suggest that the study of
                   climate-change adaptation could benefit from a
                   re-integration with biological and evolutionary
                   conceptions of human adaptation. This integration
                   would allow us to employ the substantial theoretical
                   tools of evolutionary biology and anthropology to
                   understand what promotes or impedes adaptation. The
                   evolutionary perspective on adaptation focuses on
                   diversity because diversity drives adaptive
                   evolution. Population structures are also critical in
                   facilitating or preventing adaptation to local
                   environmental conditions. This suggests that
                   climate-change adaptation should focus on the sources
                   of innovation and social structures that nurture
                   innovations and allow them to spread. Truly
                   innovative ideas are likely to arise on the periphery
                   of cohesive social groups and spread inward. The
                   evolutionary perspective also suggests that we pay
                   careful attention to correlated traits, which can
                   distort adaptive trajectories, as well as to the
                   importance of risk management in adaptations to
                   variable or uncertain environments. Finally, we
                   suggest that climate-change adaptation could benefit
                   from a broader study of how local groups adapt to
                   their dynamic environments, a process we call
                   “autochthonous adaptation.”.},

                   paradoxical conclusion that social learning does not
                   increase the fitness of a population. We expand on
                   this model, allowing for imperfections in individual
                   and social learning as well as incorporating a
                   “critical social learning” strategy that tries to
                   solve an adaptive problem first by social learning,
                   and then by individual learning if socially acquired
                   behavior proves unsatisfactory. This strategy always
                   proves superior to pure social learning and typically
                   has higher fitness than pure individual learning,
                   providing a solution to Rogers's paradox of
                   nonadaptive culture. Critical social learning is an
                   evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) unless cultural
                   transmission is highly unfaithful, the environment is
                   highly variable, or social learning is much more
                   costly than individual learning. We compare the model

                   animals readily complement their personal knowledge
                   with additional social information. To balance the
                   costs and benefits of copying others, animals have to
                   discern situations in which it is more advantageous
                   to use social rather than personal information. Here,
                   we used foraging bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) in a
                   controlled laboratory setting and showed that the
                   difficulty of a foraging task affects how the bees
                   weight the 2 types of information. We used artificial
                   flowers to devise easy and difficult discriminatory
                   tasks, and tested the influence of floral and social
                   cues on decision making. When facing an easy
                   discrimination task, foraging bees were likely to
                   rely on personal information and were only marginally
                   affected by social information. By contrast, they
                   prioritized social over personal information when
                   flower discrimination was difficult and therefore the
                   probability of making errors was higher. In summary,
                   bees are able to use social and personal information
                   to optimize foraging decisions in a flexible way.},

                   debate, it remains an open question whether a
                   reliance on social learning can also lead to
                   mismatched or maladaptive behavior. In a previous
                   study, we experimentally induced traditions for
                   opening a bidirectional door puzzle box in replicate
                   subpopulations of the great tit Parus major.
                   Individuals were conformist social learners,
                   resulting in stable cultural behaviors. Here, we vary
                   the rewards gained by these techniques to ask to what
                   extent established behaviors are flexible to changing
                   conditions. When subpopulations with established
                   foraging traditions for one technique were subjected
                   to a reduced foraging payoff, 49% of birds switched
                   their behavior to a higher-payoff foraging technique
                   after only 14 days, with younger individuals showing
                   a faster rate of change. We elucidated the
                   decision-making process for each individual, using a
                   mechanistic learning model to demonstrate that,
                   perhaps surprisingly, this population-level change
                   was achieved without significant asocial exploration
                   and without any evidence for payoff-biased copying.
                   Rather, by combining conformist social learning with
                   payoff-sensitive individual reinforcement (updating
                   of experience), individuals and populations could
                   both acquire adaptive behavior and track

                   collective 'wisdom' and other times maladaptive

                   this conflict is regulated by the social learning
                   strategies deployed. We examined the patterns of
                   human social learning through an interactive online
                   experiment with 699 participants, varying both task
                   uncertainty and group size, then used hierarchical
                   Bayesian model-fitting to identify the individual
                   learning strategies exhibited by participants.
                   Challenging tasks elicit greater conformity amongst
                   individuals, with rates of copying increasing with
                   group size, leading to high probabilities of
                   maladaptive herding amongst large groups confronted
                   with uncertainty. Conversely, the reduced social
                   learning of small groups, and the greater probability
                   that social information would be accurate for
                   less-challenging tasks, generated 'wisdom of the
                   crowd' effects in other circumstances. Our
                   model-based approach provides novel evidence that the
                   likelihood of swarm intelligence versus herding can

                   humanity, yet it remains unclear why copying is
                   profitable and how to copy most effectively. To
                   address these questions, we organized a computer
                   tournament in which entrants submitted strategies
                   specifying how to use social learning and its asocial
                   alternative (for example, trial-andor learning) to
                   acquire adaptive behavior in a complex environment.
                   Most current theory predicts the emergence of mixed
                   strategies that rely on some combination of the two
                   types of learning. In the tournament, however,
                   strategies that relied heavily on social learning
                   were found to be remarkably successful, even when
                   asocial information was no more costly than social
                   information. Social learning proved advantageous
                   because individuals frequently demonstrated the
                   highest-payoff behavior in their repertoire,
                   inadvertently filtering information for copiers. The

                   environments, but only if social learning provides
                   reliable, useful information in that environment.
                   Early life conditions provide a potential cue to the
                   reliability of social information later in life.
                   Here, we addressed whether direct early life
                   experience of the utility of social learning
                   influences later social learning propensities. We
                   reared guppy, Poecilia reticulata, fry for 45 days in
                   three different social conditions which involved the
                   presence of adult demonstrators providing cues about
                   feeding locations in the tanks (‘follow adults' and
                   ‘avoid adults' treatments), or their absence (‘no
                   adults' treatment). In the ‘follow adults'
                   treatment, juveniles that swam in the same direction
                   as the adult demonstrators found food, whereas in the
                   ‘avoid adults' treatment, subjects that swam in the
                   opposite direction to the demonstrators found food.
                   We then tested the fish with a social learning task,
                   to examine whether prior experience had influenced
                   the social learning tendencies of the juveniles.
                   After another 45 days of rearing under common-garden
                   conditions with no adult fish present in the tanks,
                   subjects were retested with the same social learning
                   task, to investigate whether early experiences had
                   effects persisting into adulthood. After 45 days of
                   rearing we found no evidence for social learning in
                   any of the experimental groups. However, after 90
                   days of rearing, we found evidence of social
                   learning, but only in the ‘follow adults'
                   treatment. These results suggest that social learning
                   propensities may develop over life, and that prior
                   exposure to conspecifics providing useful foraging
                   information during early life can shape the degree of
                   reliance on social learning in adulthood.},

                   towards conspecifics may lead to suboptimal foraging
                   performance because the presence of multiple
                   pollinators typically results in a faster rate of
                   nectar depletion in the flower. We tested the
                   capacity of bees to learn to avoid flowers occupied
                   by conspecifics when they offered a lower reward than
                   unoccupied similar flowers. Bumblebees were able to
                   discriminate between poorly and highly rewarding
                   flowers by using the presence of a nonsocial cue (a
                   wooden rectangular white block). When poorly
                   rewarding flowers were indicated by social cues

                   between the two flower types except when an
                   additional cue was provided (flower colour). These
                   findings indicate that bumblebees attach particular
                   meaning to conspecific presence on flowers, even when
                   this could lead to suboptimal foraging performance.
                   The relatively lower flexibility in the use of social
                   than nonsocial cues suggests a biased positive value

                   optimal solution to this "explore- exploit" dilemma
                   is often computationally challenging, but principled
                   algorithmic approximations exist. These
                   approximations utilize uncertainty about action
                   values in different ways. Some random exploration
                   algorithms scale the level of choice stochasticity
                   with the level of uncertainty. Other directed
                   exploration algorithms add a "bonus" to action values
                   with high uncertainty. Random exploration algorithms
                   are sensitive to total uncertainty across actions,
                   whereas directed exploration algorithms are sensitive
                   to relative uncertainty. This article reports a
                   multiarmed bandit experiment in which total and
                   relative uncertainty were orthogonally manipulated.
                   We found that humans employ both exploration
                   strategies, and that these strategies are
                   independently controlled by different uncertainty

                   non-human animals, and artificial agents to make
                   adaptive decisions about when they should copy other
                   agents, and who they should copy. Behavioural
                   ecologists and economists have discovered an
                   impressive range of SLSs, and explored their likely
                   impact on behavioural efficiency and reproductive
                   fitness while using the ‘phenotypic gambit';
                   ignoring, or remaining deliberately agnostic about,
                   the nature and origins of the cognitive processes
                   that implement SLSs. Here I argue that this
                   ‘blackboxing' of SLSs is no longer a viable
                   scientific strategy. It has contributed, through the
                   ‘social learning strategies tournament', to the
                   premature conclusion that social learning is
                   generally better than asocial learning, and to a deep
                   puzzle about the relationship between SLSs and
                   cultural evolution. The puzzle can be solved by
                   recognizing that whereas most SLSs are
                   ‘planetary'—they depend on domain-general
                   cognitive processes—some SLSs, found only in
                   humans, are ‘cook-like'—they depend on explicit,
                   metacognitive rules, such as copy digital natives.
                   These metacognitive SLSs contribute to cultural
                   evolution by fostering the development of processes
                   that enhance the exclusivity, specificity, and
                   accuracy of social learning.},

                   that is simply described, well-suited to controlled
                   laboratory study, and representative of a broad class
                   of real-world problems. In bandit problems, people
                   must choose between a set of alternatives, each with
                   different unknown reward rates, to maximize the total
                   reward they receive over a fixed number of trials. A
                   key feature of the task is that it challenges people
                   to balance the exploration of unfamiliar choices with
                   the exploitation of familiar ones. We use a Bayesian
                   model of optimal decision-making on the task, in
                   which how people balance exploration with
                   exploitation depends on their assumptions about the
                   distribution of reward rates. We also use Bayesian
                   model selection measures that assess how well people
                   adhere to an optimal decision process, compared to
                   simpler heuristic decision strategies. Using these
                   models, we make inferences about the decision-making
                   of 451 participants who completed a set of bandit
                   problems, and relate various measures of their

                   including psychometric assessments of cognitive
                   abilities and personality traits. We find clear

                   science and computational science to create a new
                   approach to numerical computing. Julia is designed to
                   be easy and fast and questions notions generally held
                   to be "laws of nature" by practitioners of numerical
                   computing: 1. High-level dynamic programs have to be
                   slow. 2. One must prototype in one language and then
                   rewrite in another language for speed or deployment.
                   3. There are parts of a system appropriate for the
                   programmer, and other parts that are best left
                   untouched as they have been built by the experts. We
                   introduce the Julia programming language and its
                   design-a dance between specialization and
                   abstraction. Specialization allows for custom

                   computer science, picks the right algorithm for the
                   right circumstance. Abstraction, which is what good
                   computation is really about, recognizes what remains
                   the same after differences are stripped away.
                   Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code
                   through another technique from computer science,
                   generic programming. Julia shows that one can achieve

                   an integral method for modeling and simulating
                   complex systems, such as socio-economic problems.
                   Since agent-based models are not described by simple
                   and concise mathematical equations, the code that
                   generates them is typically complicated, large, and
                   slow. Here we present Agents.jl, a Julia-based
                   software that provides an ABM analysis platform with
                   minimal code complexity. We compare our software with
                   some of the most popular ABM software in other

                   the relative strength of their conformist social
                   learning biases. Here we use both treatment effects

                   those traits, (3) the fidelity of transmission, and

                   transmission. The strength of conformist transmission
                   increases with group size, but only when there were 2
                   traits in the environment. Using individual-level
                   variation and recognizing that treatment effects

                   that IQ negatively predicts social learning, but has
                   a U-shaped relationship to conformist transmission,
                   suggesting strategic use of conformist-biased social
                   learning among those with the highest IQ. Other

                   past experiments, both human and non-human, have

  abstract =      {Choosing from whom to learn is an important element
                   of social learning. It affects learner success and
                   the profile of behaviors in the population. Because
                   individuals often differ in their traits and
                   capabilities, their benefits from different behaviors
                   may also vary. Homophily, or assortment, the tendency
                   of individuals to interact with other individuals
                   with similar traits, is known to affect the spread of
                   behaviors in humans. We introduce models to study the
                   evolution of assortative social learning (ASL), where
                   assorting on a trait acts as an individual-specific
                   mechanism for filtering relevant models from which to
                   learn when that trait varies. We show that when the
                   trait is polymorphic, ASL may maintain a stable
                   behavioral polymorphism within a population
                   (independently of coexistence with individual
                   learning in a population). We explore the evolution
                   of ASL when assortment is based on a nonheritable or
                   partially heritable trait, and when ASL competes with
                   different non-ASL strategies: oblique (learning from
                   the parental generation) and vertical (learning from
                   the parent). We suggest that the tendency to assort
                   may be advantageous in the context of social
                   learning, and that ASL might be an important concept
                   for the evolutionary theory of social learning.

                   strengthened (reinforced) if it produces favourable
                   results, and weakened if it produces unfavourable
                   results. Q-learning is a recent RL algorithm that
                   does not need a model of its environment and can be
                   used on-line. Therefore, it is well suited for use in
                   repeated games against an unknown opponent. Most RL
                   research has been confined to single-agent settings
                   or to multiagent settings where the agents have
                   totally positively correlated payoffs (team problems)
                   or totally negatively correlated payoffs (zero-sum
                   games). This paper is an empirical study of
                   reinforcement learning in the Iterated Prisoner's
                   Dilemma (IPD), where the agents' payoffs are neither
                   totally positively nor totally negatively correlated.
                   RL is considerably more difficult in such a domain.
                   This paper investigates the ability of a variety of
                   Q-learning agents to play the IPD game against an
                   unknown opponent. In some experiments, the opponent
                   is the fixed strategy Tit-For-Tat, while in others it
                   is another Q-learner. All the Q-learners learned to
                   play optimally against Tit-For-Tat. Playing against
                   another learner was more difficult because the
                   adaptation of the other learner created a
                   non-stationary environment, and because the other
                   learner was not endowed with any a priori knowledge
                   about the IPD game such as a policy designed to
                   encourage cooperation. The learners that were studied
                   varied along three dimensions: the length of history
                   they received as context, the type of memory they
                   employed (look up tables based on restricted history
                   windows or recurrent neural networks that can
                   theoretically store features from arbitrarily deep in
                   the past), and the exploration schedule they
                   followed. Although all the learners faced
                   difficulties when playing against other learners,
                   agents with longer history windows, lookup table
                   memories, and longer exploration schedules fared best
                   in the IPD games.},

  abstract =      {Social learning is a key component of human and
                   animal intelligence. By taking cues from the behavior
                   of experts in their environment, social learners can
                   acquire sophisticated behavior and rapidly adapt to
                   new circumstances. This paper investigates whether
                   independent reinforcement learning (RL) agents in a
                   multi-agent environment can learn to use social
                   learning to improve their performance. We find that
                   in most circumstances, vanilla model-free RL agents
                   do not use social learning. We analyze the reasons
                   for this deficiency, and show that by imposing
                   constraints on the training environment and
                   introducing a model-based auxiliary loss we are able
                   to obtain generalized social learning policies which
                   enable agents to: i) discover complex skills that are
                   not learned from single-agent training, and ii) adapt
                   online to novel environments by taking cues from
                   experts present in the new environment. In contrast,
                   agents trained with model-free RL or imitation
                   learning generalize poorly and do not succeed in the
                   transfer tasks. By mixing multi-agent and solo
                   training, we can obtain agents that use social
                   learning to gain skills that they can deploy when
                   alone, even out-performing agents trained alone from
                   the start.},

                   sublime success in various domains. Although the
                   multi-agent domain has been overshadowed by its
                   single-agent counterpart during this progress,
                   multi-agent reinforcement learning gains rapid
                   traction, and the latest accomplishments address
                   problems with real-world complexity. This article
                   provides an overview of the current developments in
                   the field of multi-agent deep reinforcement learning.
                   We focus primarily on literature from recent years
                   that combines deep reinforcement learning methods
                   with a multi-agent scenario. To survey the works that
                   constitute the contemporary landscape, the main
                   contents are divided into three parts. First, we
                   analyze the structure of training schemes that are
                   applied to train multiple agents. Second, we consider
                   the emergent patterns of agent behavior in
                   cooperative, competitive and mixed scenarios. Third,
                   we systematically enumerate challenges that
                   exclusively arise in the multi-agent domain and
                   review methods that are leveraged to cope with these
                   challenges. To conclude this survey, we discuss
                   advances, identify trends, and outline possible
                   directions for future work in this research area.},

                   coordination and communication in Multi-Agent
                   Reinforcement Learning (MARL), through rewarding
                   agents for having causal influence over other agents'
                   actions. Causal influence is assessed using
                   counterfactual reasoning. At each timestep, an agent
                   simulates alternate actions that it could have taken,
                   and computes their effect on the behavior of other
                   agents. Actions that lead to bigger changes in other
                   agents' behavior are considered influential and are
                   rewarded. We show that this is equivalent to
                   rewarding agents for having high mutual information
                   between their actions. Empirical results demonstrate
                   that influence leads to enhanced coordination and
                   communication in challenging social dilemma
                   environments, dramatically increasing the learning
                   curves of the deep RL agents, and leading to more
                   meaningful learned communication protocols. The
                   influence rewards for all agents can be computed in a
                   decentralized way by enabling agents to learn a model
                   of other agents using deep neural networks. In
                   contrast, key previous works on emergent
                   communication in the MARL setting were unable to
                   learn diverse policies in a decentralized manner and
                   had to resort to centralized training. Consequently,
                   the influence reward opens up a window of new
                   opportunities for research in this area.},

    abstract = { Humans are characterized by an extreme dependence on culturally transmitted information. Such dependence requires the complex integration of social and asocial information to generate effective learning and decision making. Recent formal theory predicts that natural selection should favour adaptive learning strategies, but relevant empirical work is scarce and rarely examines multiple strategies or tasks. We tested nine hypotheses derived from theoretical models, running a series of experiments investigating factors affecting when and how humans use social information, and whether such behaviour is adaptive, across several computer-based tasks. The number of demonstrators, consensus among demonstrators, confidence of subjects, task difficulty, number of sessions, cost of asocial learning, subject performance and demonstrator performance all influenced subjects' use of social information, and did so adaptively. Our analysis provides strong support for the hypothesis that human social learning is regulated by adaptive learning rules. }

abstract = {In order to understand how organisms cope with ongoing changes in environmental variability, it is necessary to consider multiple adaptations to environmental uncertainty on different time scales. Conservative bet-hedging (CBH) represents a long-term genotype-level strategy maximizing lineage geometric mean fitness in stochastic environments by decreasing individual fitness variance, despite also lowering arithmetic mean fitness. Meanwhile, variance-prone (aka risk-prone) strategies produce greater variance in shortterm payoffs, because this increases expected arithmetic mean fitness if the relationship between payoffs and fitness is accelerating. Using evolutionary simulation models, we investigate whether selection for such variance-prone strategies is counteracted by selection for bet-hedging that works to adaptively reduce fitness variance. In our model, variance proneness evolves in finegrained environments (lower correlations among individuals in energetic state and/or payoffs), and with larger numbers of independent decision events over which resources accumulate prior to selection. Conversely, multiplicative fitness accumulation, caused by coarser environmental grain and fewer decision events selection, favours CBH via greater variance aversion. We discuss examples of variance-sensitive strategies in optimal foraging, migration, life histories and cooperative breeding using this bet-hedging perspective. By linking disparate fields of research studying adaptations to variable environments, we should be better able to understand effects of human-induced rapid environmental change.},

abstract = {Culture is an outcome of both the acquisition of knowledge about behaviour through social transmission, and its subsequent production by individuals. Acquisition and production are often discussed or modelled interchangeably, yet to date no study has explored the consequences of their interaction for cultural diffusions. We present a generative model that integrates the two, and ask how variation in production rules might influence diffusion dynamics. Agents make behavioural choices that change as they learn from their productions. Their repertoires may also change, and the acquisition of behaviour is conditioned on its frequency. We analyse the diffusion of a novel behaviour through social networks, yielding generalizable predictions of how individual-level behavioural production rules influence population-level diffusion dynamics. We then investigate how linking acquisition and production might affect the performance of two commonly used inferential models for social learning; network-based diffusion analysis, and experience-weighted attraction models. We find that the influence that production rules have on diffusion dynamics has consequences for how inferential methods are applied to empirical data. Our model illuminates the differences between social learning and social influence, demonstrates the overlooked role of reinforcement learning in cultural diffusions, and allows for clearer discussions about social learning strategies.},
