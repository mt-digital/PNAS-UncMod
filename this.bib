                   strategies that individuals employ to acquire
                   behavior from others. These strategies themselves are
                   partly products of natural selection, making the
                   study of social learning an inherently Darwinian
                   project. Formal models of the evolution of social
                   learning suggest that reliance on social learning
                   should increase with task difficulty and decrease
                   with the probability of environmental change. These
                   models also make predictions about how individuals
                   integrate information from multiple peers. We present
                   the results of microsociety experiments designed to
                   evaluate these predictions. The first experiment
                   measures baseline individual learning strategy in a
                   two-armed bandit environment with variation in task
                   difficulty and temporal fluctuation in the payoffs of
                   the options. Our second experiment addresses how
                   people in the same environment use minimal social
                   information from a single peer. Our third experiment
                   expands on the second by allowing access to the
                   behavior of several other individuals, permitting
                   frequency-dependent strategies like conformity. In
                   each of these experiments, we vary task difficulty
                   and environmental fluctuation. We present several
                   candidate strategies and compute the expected payoffs
                   to each in our experimental environment. We then fit
                   to the data the different models of the use of social
                   information and identify the best-fitting model via
                   model comparison techniques. We find substantial
                   evidence of both conformist and nonconformist social
                   learning and compare our results to theoretical
                   expectations. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All

                   accommodate recent findings that individuals switch

                   paradoxical conclusion that social learning does not
                   increase the fitness of a population. We expand on
                   this model, allowing for imperfections in individual
                   and social learning as well as incorporating a
                   “critical social learning” strategy that tries to
                   solve an adaptive problem first by social learning,
                   and then by individual learning if socially acquired
                   behavior proves unsatisfactory. This strategy always

                   we used foraging bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) in a
                   controlled laboratory setting and showed that the
                   difficulty of a foraging task affects how the bees
                   weight the 2 types of information. We used artificial
                   flowers to devise easy and difficult discriminatory
                   tasks, and tested the influence of floral and social
                   cues on decision making. When facing an easy

                   reliance on social learning can also lead to
                   mismatched or maladaptive behavior. In a previous
                   study, we experimentally induced traditions for
                   opening a bidirectional door puzzle box in replicate
                   subpopulations of the great tit Parus major.
                   Individuals were conformist social learners,
                   resulting in stable cultural behaviors. Here, we vary
                   the rewards gained by these techniques to ask to what
                   extent established behaviors are flexible to changing
                   conditions. When subpopulations with established
                   foraging traditions for one technique were subjected
                   to a reduced foraging payoff, 49% of birds switched
                   their behavior to a higher-payoff foraging technique
                   after only 14 days, with younger individuals showing
                   a faster rate of change. We elucidated the

                   mechanistic learning model to demonstrate that,
                   perhaps surprisingly, this population-level change
                   was achieved without significant asocial exploration
                   and without any evidence for payoff-biased copying.
                   Rather, by combining conformist social learning with
                   payoff-sensitive individual reinforcement (updating
                   of experience), individuals and populations could
                   both acquire adaptive behavior and track

                   this conflict is regulated by the social learning
                   strategies deployed. We examined the patterns of
                   human social learning through an interactive online
                   experiment with 699 participants, varying both task
                   uncertainty and group size, then used hierarchical
                   Bayesian model-fitting to identify the individual
                   learning strategies exhibited by participants.
                   Challenging tasks elicit greater conformity amongst
                   individuals, with rates of copying increasing with
                   group size, leading to high probabilities of
                   maladaptive herding amongst large groups confronted
                   with uncertainty. Conversely, the reduced social

                   people living in similar environments exhibit
                   strikingly different patterns of behavior because
                   they have different, culturally acquired beliefs and
                   values. Such cultural transmission is based on
                   complex, derived psychological mechanisms that are
                   likely to have been shaped by natural selection. It
                   is important to understand the nature of these
                   evolved psychological mechanisms because they
                   determine which beliefs and values spread and persist
                   in human groups. Boyd and Richerson showed that a
                   tendency to acquire the most common behavior
                   exhibited in a society was adaptive in a simple model
                   of evolution in a spatially varying environment,
                   because such a tendency increases the probability of
                   acquiring adaptive beliefs and values. Here, we study
                   the evolution of such "conformist transmission" in a
                   more general model in which environments vary in both
                   time and space. The analysis of this model indicates
                   that conformist transmission is favored under a very
                   broad range of conditions, broader in fact than the
                   range of conditions that favor a substantial reliance
                   on social learning. The analysis also suggests that
                   there is a synergistic relationship between the
                   evolution of imitation and the evolution of
                   conformism. We conclude by examining the role of
                   conformism in explaining the maintenance of cultural
                   differences among groups. {\textcopyright} 1998

                   adaptive decisions about when they should copy other
                   agents, and who they should copy. Behavioural
                   ecologists and economists have discovered an
                   impressive range of SLSs, and explored their likely
                   impact on behavioural efficiency and reproductive
                   fitness while using the ‘phenotypic gambit';
                   ignoring, or remaining deliberately agnostic about,
                   the nature and origins of the cognitive processes
                   that implement SLSs. Here I argue that this
                   ‘blackboxing' of SLSs is no longer a viable
                   scientific strategy. It has contributed, through the
                   ‘social learning strategies tournament', to the
                   premature conclusion that social learning is
                   generally better than asocial learning, and to a deep
                   puzzle about the relationship between SLSs and
                   cultural evolution. The puzzle can be solved by
                   recognizing that whereas most SLSs are
                   ‘planetary'—they depend on domain-general
                   cognitive processes—some SLSs, found only in
                   humans, are ‘cook-like'—they depend on explicit,
                   metacognitive rules, such as copy digital natives.
                   These metacognitive SLSs contribute to cultural
                   evolution by fostering the development of processes
                   that enhance the exclusivity, specificity, and
                   accuracy of social learning.},

                   that is simply described, well-suited to controlled
                   laboratory study, and representative of a broad class
                   of real-world problems. In bandit problems, people
                   must choose between a set of alternatives, each with
                   different unknown reward rates, to maximize the total
                   reward they receive over a fixed number of trials. A
                   key feature of the task is that it challenges people
                   to balance the exploration of unfamiliar choices with
                   the exploitation of familiar ones. We use a Bayesian
                   model of optimal decision-making on the task, in
                   which how people balance exploration with
                   exploitation depends on their assumptions about the
                   distribution of reward rates. We also use Bayesian
                   model selection measures that assess how well people
                   adhere to an optimal decision process, compared to
                   simpler heuristic decision strategies. Using these
                   models, we make inferences about the decision-making

                   conflict between the opposing demands of gathering
                   and exploiting information. In a classic illustration
                   of this 'exploration-exploitation' dilemma, a gambler
                   choosing between multiple slot machines balances the
                   desire to select what seems, on the basis of
                   accumulated experience, the richest option, against
                   the desire to choose a less familiar option that
                   might turn out more advantageous (and thereby provide
                   information for improving future decisions). Far from
                   representing idle curiosity, such exploration is
                   often critical for organisms to discover how best to
                   harvest resources such as food and water. In
                   appetitive choice, substantial experimental evidence,
                   underpinned by computational reinforcement learning
                   (RL) theory, indicates that a dopaminergic, striatal
                   and medial prefrontal network mediates learning to
                   exploit. In contrast, although exploration has been
                   well studied from both theoretical and ethological
                   perspectives, its neural substrates are much less
                   clear. Here we show, in a gambling task, that human

                   the explore/exploit dilemma. Furthermore, using this
                   characterization to classify decisions as exploratory
                   or exploitative, we employ functional magnetic
                   resonance imaging to show that the frontopolar cortex
                   and intraparietal sulcus are preferentially active
                   during exploratory decisions. In contrast, regions of
                   striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex exhibit
                   activity characteristic of an involvement in
                   value-based exploitative decision making. The results
                   suggest a model of action selection under uncertainty
                   that involves switching between exploratory and

                   in learning models for predicting behavior in
                   decisions based on experience. In such decisions, the
                   probabilities and payoffs are initially unknown and
                   are learned from repeated choice with payoff
                   feedback. We examined combinations of two rules for
                   updating past experience with new payoff feedback and
                   of two choice rule assumptions for mapping experience
                   onto choices. The combination of these assumptions
                   produced four classes of models that were
                   systematically compared. Two methods were employed to
                   evaluate the success of learning models for
                   approximating players' choices: One was based on
                   estimating parameters from each person's data to
                   maximize the prediction of choices one step ahead,
                   conditioned by the observed past history of feedback.
                   The second was based on making a priori predictions
                   for the entire sequence of choices using parameters
                   estimated from a separate experiment. The results
                   indicated the advantage of a class of models
                   incorporating decay of previous experience, whereas
                   the ranking of choice rules depended on the

                   combines expertise from the diverse helds of computer
                   science and computational science to create a new
                   approach to numerical computing. Julia is designed to
                   be easy and fast and questions notions generally held
                   to be "laws of nature" by practitioners of numerical
                   computing: 1. High-level dynamic programs have to be
                   slow. 2. One must prototype in one language and then
                   rewrite in another language for speed or deployment.
                   3. There are parts of a system appropriate for the
                   programmer, and other parts that are best left
                   untouched as they have been built by the experts. We
                   introduce the Julia programming language and its
                   design-a dance between specialization and
                   abstraction. Specialization allows for custom
                   treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from
                   computer science, picks the right algorithm for the
                   right circumstance. Abstraction, which is what good
                   computation is really about, recognizes what remains
                   the same after differences are stripped away.
                   Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code
                   through another technique from computer science,
                   generic programming. Julia shows that one can achieve
                   machine performance without sacrificing human
                   convenience.},

                   an integral method for modeling and simulating
                   complex systems, such as socio-economic problems.
                   Since agent-based models are not described by simple
                   and concise mathematical equations, the code that
                   generates them is typically complicated, large, and
                   slow. Here we present Agents.jl, a Julia-based
                   software that provides an ABM analysis platform with
                   minimal code complexity. We compare our software with
                   some of the most popular ABM software in other

  abstract =      {The idea of adaptation, in which an organism or
                   population becomes better suited to its environment,
                   is used in a variety of disciplines. Originating in
                   evolutionary biology, adaptation has been a central
                   theme in biological anthropology and human ecology.
                   More recently, the study of adaptation in the context
                   of climate change has become an important topic of
                   research in the social sciences. While there are
                   clearly commonalities in the different uses of the
                   concept of adaptation in these fields, there are also
                   substantial differences. We describe these
                   differences and suggest that the study of
                   climate-change adaptation could benefit from a
                   re-integration with biological and evolutionary
                   conceptions of human adaptation. This integration
                   would allow us to employ the substantial theoretical
                   tools of evolutionary biology and anthropology to
                   understand what promotes or impedes adaptation. The
                   evolutionary perspective on adaptation focuses on
                   diversity because diversity drives adaptive
                   evolution. Population structures are also critical in
                   facilitating or preventing adaptation to local
                   environmental conditions. This suggests that
                   climate-change adaptation should focus on the sources
                   of innovation and social structures that nurture
                   innovations and allow them to spread. Truly
                   innovative ideas are likely to arise on the periphery
                   of cohesive social groups and spread inward. The
                   evolutionary perspective also suggests that we pay
                   careful attention to correlated traits, which can
                   distort adaptive trajectories, as well as to the
                   importance of risk management in adaptations to
                   variable or uncertain environments. Finally, we
                   suggest that climate-change adaptation could benefit
                   from a broader study of how local groups adapt to
                   their dynamic environments, a process we call
                   “autochthonous adaptation.”.},

                   the relative strength of their conformist social
                   learning biases. Here we use both treatment effects
                   and individual variation to test predictions about
                   the impact of (1) the number of traits in an
                   environment, (2) the adaptive or payoff relevance of
                   those traits, (3) the fidelity of transmission, and
                   (4) the size of groups. We find that both social
                   learning and the strength of conformist transmission
                   increase with the number of traits, the adaptive
                   value of those traits, and the fidelity of
                   transmission. The strength of conformist transmission
                   increases with group size, but only when there were 2
                   traits in the environment. Using individual-level
                   variation and recognizing that treatment effects
                   predictably impact individuals differently, we show
                   that IQ negatively predicts social learning, but has
                   a U-shaped relationship to conformist transmission,
                   suggesting strategic use of conformist-biased social
                   learning among those with the highest IQ. Other
                   plausible predictors, such as status, cultural
                   background, and personality, were not predictive.
                   Broadly, our results reveal that not only is the
                   conformist transmission bias ubiquitous, but that
                   past experiments, both human and non-human, have
                   likely underestimated its prevalence and the
                   prevalence of social learning by restricting designs

                   information and behavior, and the evolution of social
                   phenotypes. After dispersal, organisms move around
                   throughout their lives, and the patterns of their
                   movement influence their social encounters over the
                   course of their lifespan. Though both space and
                   mobility are known to influence social evolution,
                   there is little analysis of the influence of specific
                   movement patterns on evolutionary dynamics. We
                   explored the effects of random movement strategies on
                   the evolution of cooperation using an agent-based
                   prisoner's dilemma model with mobile agents. This is
                   the first systematic analysis of a model in which
                   cooperators and defectors can use different random
                   movement strategies, which we chose to fall on a
                   spectrum between highly exploratory and highly
                   restricted in their search tendencies. Because
                   limited dispersal and restrictions to local
                   neighborhood size are known to influence the ability
                   of cooperators to effectively assort, we also
                   assessed the robustness of our findings with respect
                   to dispersal and local capacity constraints. We show
                   that differences in patterns of movement can
                   dramatically influence the likelihood of cooperator
                   success, and that the effects of different movement
                   patterns are sensitive to environmental assumptions
                   about offspring dispersal and local space
                   constraints. Since local interactions implicitly
                   generate dynamic social interaction networks, we also
                   measured the average number of unique and total
                   interactions over a lifetime and considered how these
                   emergent network dynamics helped explain the results.
                   This work extends what is known about mobility and
                   the evolution of cooperation, and also has general
                   implications for social models with randomly moving

                   construction. According to the first, affordances are
                   resources that exert selection pressure. The second
                   view claims that affordances are ecological
                   inheritances in the organism's niche that are the
                   product of a previous alteration of the environment.
                   While there seems to be a mutually exclusive
                   definition of affordances in each of these views, I
                   argue in this paper that the views are not competing
                   but, rather, complementary. In this sense,
                   affordances play the role of either resources or
                   ecological inheritances depending on the temporal
                   stage of the evolutionary process. I make this
                   argument by analyzing how natural selection and niche
                   construction affect each other even when they
                   function independently from each other. In this
                   light, if these two evolutionary mechanisms exert
                   their power in parallel but at two different stages
                   in the evolutionary history of a given econiche, then
                   there is room to claim that affordances can be
                   understood as both resources and ecological
                   inheritances. This dual aspect of affordances shows
                   their evolutionary role.},

  abstract =      {Reinforcement learning (RL) is based on the idea that
                   the tendency to produce an action should be
                   strengthened (reinforced) if it produces favourable
                   results, and weakened if it produces unfavourable
                   results. Q-learning is a recent RL algorithm that
                   does not need a model of its environment and can be
                   used on-line. Therefore, it is well suited for use in
                   repeated games against an unknown opponent. Most RL
                   research has been confined to single-agent settings
                   or to multiagent settings where the agents have
                   totally positively correlated payoffs (team problems)
                   or totally negatively correlated payoffs (zero-sum
                   games). This paper is an empirical study of
                   reinforcement learning in the Iterated Prisoner's
                   Dilemma (IPD), where the agents' payoffs are neither
                   totally positively nor totally negatively correlated.
                   RL is considerably more difficult in such a domain.
                   This paper investigates the ability of a variety of
                   Q-learning agents to play the IPD game against an
                   unknown opponent. In some experiments, the opponent
                   is the fixed strategy Tit-For-Tat, while in others it
                   is another Q-learner. All the Q-learners learned to
                   play optimally against Tit-For-Tat. Playing against
                   another learner was more difficult because the
                   adaptation of the other learner created a
                   non-stationary environment, and because the other
                   learner was not endowed with any a priori knowledge
                   about the IPD game such as a policy designed to
                   encourage cooperation. The learners that were studied
                   varied along three dimensions: the length of history
                   they received as context, the type of memory they
                   employed (look up tables based on restricted history
                   windows or recurrent neural networks that can
                   theoretically store features from arbitrarily deep in
                   the past), and the exploration schedule they
                   followed. Although all the learners faced
                   difficulties when playing against other learners,
                   agents with longer history windows, lookup table
                   memories, and longer exploration schedules fared best
                   in the IPD games.},

  abstract =      {Social learning is a key component of human and
                   animal intelligence. By taking cues from the behavior
                   of experts in their environment, social learners can
                   acquire sophisticated behavior and rapidly adapt to
                   new circumstances. This paper investigates whether
                   independent reinforcement learning (RL) agents in a
                   multi-agent environment can learn to use social
                   learning to improve their performance. We find that
                   in most circumstances, vanilla model-free RL agents
                   do not use social learning. We analyze the reasons
                   for this deficiency, and show that by imposing
                   constraints on the training environment and
                   introducing a model-based auxiliary loss we are able
                   to obtain generalized social learning policies which
                   enable agents to: i) discover complex skills that are
                   not learned from single-agent training, and ii) adapt
                   online to novel environments by taking cues from
                   experts present in the new environment. In contrast,
                   agents trained with model-free RL or imitation
                   learning generalize poorly and do not succeed in the
                   transfer tasks. By mixing multi-agent and solo
                   training, we can obtain agents that use social
                   learning to gain skills that they can deploy when
                   alone, even out-performing agents trained alone from
                   the start.},

  abstract =      {The advances in reinforcement learning have recorded
                   sublime success in various domains. Although the
                   multi-agent domain has been overshadowed by its
                   single-agent counterpart during this progress,
                   multi-agent reinforcement learning gains rapid
                   traction, and the latest accomplishments address
                   problems with real-world complexity. This article
                   provides an overview of the current developments in
                   the field of multi-agent deep reinforcement learning.
                   We focus primarily on literature from recent years
                   that combines deep reinforcement learning methods
                   with a multi-agent scenario. To survey the works that
                   constitute the contemporary landscape, the main
                   contents are divided into three parts. First, we
                   analyze the structure of training schemes that are
                   applied to train multiple agents. Second, we consider
                   the emergent patterns of agent behavior in
                   cooperative, competitive and mixed scenarios. Third,
                   we systematically enumerate challenges that
                   exclusively arise in the multi-agent domain and
                   review methods that are leveraged to cope with these
                   challenges. To conclude this survey, we discuss
                   advances, identify trends, and outline possible
                   directions for future work in this research area.},

                   coordination and communication in Multi-Agent
                   Reinforcement Learning (MARL), through rewarding
                   agents for having causal influence over other agents'
                   actions. Causal influence is assessed using
                   counterfactual reasoning. At each timestep, an agent
                   simulates alternate actions that it could have taken,
                   and computes their effect on the behavior of other
                   agents. Actions that lead to bigger changes in other
                   agents' behavior are considered influential and are
                   rewarded. We show that this is equivalent to
                   rewarding agents for having high mutual information
                   between their actions. Empirical results demonstrate
                   that influence leads to enhanced coordination and
                   communication in challenging social dilemma
                   environments, dramatically increasing the learning
                   curves of the deep RL agents, and leading to more
                   meaningful learned communication protocols. The
                   influence rewards for all agents can be computed in a
                   decentralized way by enabling agents to learn a model
                   of other agents using deep neural networks. In
                   contrast, key previous works on emergent
                   communication in the MARL setting were unable to
                   learn diverse policies in a decentralized manner and
                   had to resort to centralized training. Consequently,
                   the influence reward opens up a window of new
                   opportunities for research in this area.},
