                   among human groups is cultural: genetically similar
                   people living in similar environments exhibit
                   strikingly different patterns of behavior because
                   they have different, culturally acquired beliefs and
                   values. Such cultural transmission is based on
                   complex, derived psychological mechanisms that are
                   likely to have been shaped by natural selection. It
                   is important to understand the nature of these
                   evolved psychological mechanisms because they
                   determine which beliefs and values spread and persist
                   in human groups. Boyd and Richerson showed that a
                   tendency to acquire the most common behavior
                   exhibited in a society was adaptive in a simple model
                   of evolution in a spatially varying environment,
                   because such a tendency increases the probability of
                   acquiring adaptive beliefs and values. Here, we study
                   the evolution of such "conformist transmission" in a
                   more general model in which environments vary in both
                   time and space. The analysis of this model indicates
                   that conformist transmission is favored under a very
                   broad range of conditions, broader in fact than the
                   range of conditions that favor a substantial reliance
                   on social learning. The analysis also suggests that
                   there is a synergistic relationship between the
                   evolution of imitation and the evolution of
                   conformism. We conclude by examining the role of
                   conformism in explaining the maintenance of cultural
                   differences among groups. {\textcopyright} 1998

                   strategies that individuals employ to acquire
                   behavior from others. These strategies themselves are
                   partly products of natural selection, making the
                   study of social learning an inherently Darwinian
                   project. Formal models of the evolution of social
                   learning suggest that reliance on social learning
                   should increase with task difficulty and decrease
                   with the probability of environmental change. These
                   models also make predictions about how individuals
                   integrate information from multiple peers. We present
                   the results of microsociety experiments designed to
                   evaluate these predictions. The first experiment
                   measures baseline individual learning strategy in a
                   two-armed bandit environment with variation in task
                   difficulty and temporal fluctuation in the payoffs of
                   the options. Our second experiment addresses how
                   people in the same environment use minimal social
                   information from a single peer. Our third experiment
                   expands on the second by allowing access to the
                   behavior of several other individuals, permitting
                   frequency-dependent strategies like conformity. In
                   each of these experiments, we vary task difficulty
                   and environmental fluctuation. We present several
                   candidate strategies and compute the expected payoffs
                   to each in our experimental environment. We then fit
                   to the data the different models of the use of social
                   information and identify the best-fitting model via
                   model comparison techniques. We find substantial
                   evidence of both conformist and nonconformist social
                   learning and compare our results to theoretical
                   expectations. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All

                   suggests that individuals should be selective in

                   learning strategies' (SLSs). The SLS concept has

                   accommodate recent findings that individuals switch

                   and culture occur much more broadly, and in a wider
                   variety of animal communities, than initially
                   believed. Recent research has expanded the list to
                   include insects, fishes, elephants, and cetaceans.
                   Such diversity allows scientists to expand the scope

  abstract =      {The idea of adaptation, in which an organism or
                   population becomes better suited to its environment,
                   is used in a variety of disciplines. Originating in
                   evolutionary biology, adaptation has been a central
                   theme in biological anthropology and human ecology.
                   More recently, the study of adaptation in the context
                   of climate change has become an important topic of
                   research in the social sciences. While there are
                   clearly commonalities in the different uses of the
                   concept of adaptation in these fields, there are also
                   substantial differences. We describe these
                   differences and suggest that the study of
                   climate-change adaptation could benefit from a
                   re-integration with biological and evolutionary
                   conceptions of human adaptation. This integration
                   would allow us to employ the substantial theoretical
                   tools of evolutionary biology and anthropology to
                   understand what promotes or impedes adaptation. The
                   evolutionary perspective on adaptation focuses on
                   diversity because diversity drives adaptive
                   evolution. Population structures are also critical in
                   facilitating or preventing adaptation to local
                   environmental conditions. This suggests that
                   climate-change adaptation should focus on the sources
                   of innovation and social structures that nurture
                   innovations and allow them to spread. Truly
                   innovative ideas are likely to arise on the periphery
                   of cohesive social groups and spread inward. The
                   evolutionary perspective also suggests that we pay
                   careful attention to correlated traits, which can
                   distort adaptive trajectories, as well as to the
                   importance of risk management in adaptations to
                   variable or uncertain environments. Finally, we
                   suggest that climate-change adaptation could benefit
                   from a broader study of how local groups adapt to
                   their dynamic environments, a process we call
                   “autochthonous adaptation.”.},

                   adaptive decisions about when they should copy other
                   agents, and who they should copy. Behavioural
                   ecologists and economists have discovered an
                   impressive range of SLSs, and explored their likely
                   impact on behavioural efficiency and reproductive
                   fitness while using the ‘phenotypic gambit';
                   ignoring, or remaining deliberately agnostic about,
                   the nature and origins of the cognitive processes
                   that implement SLSs. Here I argue that this
                   ‘blackboxing' of SLSs is no longer a viable
                   scientific strategy. It has contributed, through the
                   ‘social learning strategies tournament', to the
                   premature conclusion that social learning is
                   generally better than asocial learning, and to a deep
                   puzzle about the relationship between SLSs and
                   cultural evolution. The puzzle can be solved by
                   recognizing that whereas most SLSs are
                   ‘planetary'—they depend on domain-general
                   cognitive processes—some SLSs, found only in
                   humans, are ‘cook-like'—they depend on explicit,
                   metacognitive rules, such as copy digital natives.
                   These metacognitive SLSs contribute to cultural
                   evolution by fostering the development of processes
                   that enhance the exclusivity, specificity, and
                   accuracy of social learning.},

                   exploration algorithms add a "bonus" to action values
                   with high uncertainty. Random exploration algorithms
                   are sensitive to total uncertainty across actions,
                   whereas directed exploration algorithms are sensitive
                   to relative uncertainty. This article reports a
                   multiarmed bandit experiment in which total and
                   relative uncertainty were orthogonally manipulated.
                   We found that humans employ both exploration
                   strategies, and that these strategies are
                   independently controlled by different uncertainty
                   computations.},

                   tasks, and tested the influence of floral and social
                   cues on decision making. When facing an easy

                   reliance on social learning can also lead to
                   mismatched or maladaptive behavior. In a previous
                   study, we experimentally induced traditions for
                   opening a bidirectional door puzzle box in replicate
                   subpopulations of the great tit Parus major.
                   Individuals were conformist social learners,
                   resulting in stable cultural behaviors. Here, we vary
                   the rewards gained by these techniques to ask to what
                   extent established behaviors are flexible to changing
                   conditions. When subpopulations with established
                   foraging traditions for one technique were subjected
                   to a reduced foraging payoff, 49% of birds switched
                   their behavior to a higher-payoff foraging technique
                   after only 14 days, with younger individuals showing
                   a faster rate of change. We elucidated the

                   was achieved without significant asocial exploration
                   and without any evidence for payoff-biased copying.
                   Rather, by combining conformist social learning with
                   payoff-sensitive individual reinforcement (updating
                   of experience), individuals and populations could

                   collective 'wisdom' and other times maladaptive

                   this conflict is regulated by the social learning
                   strategies deployed. We examined the patterns of
                   human social learning through an interactive online
                   experiment with 699 participants, varying both task
                   uncertainty and group size, then used hierarchical
                   Bayesian model-fitting to identify the individual
                   learning strategies exhibited by participants.
                   Challenging tasks elicit greater conformity amongst
                   individuals, with rates of copying increasing with
                   group size, leading to high probabilities of
                   maladaptive herding amongst large groups confronted
                   with uncertainty. Conversely, the reduced social
                   learning of small groups, and the greater probability
                   that social information would be accurate for

                   humanity, yet it remains unclear why copying is
                   profitable and how to copy most effectively. To
                   address these questions, we organized a computer
                   tournament in which entrants submitted strategies
                   specifying how to use social learning and its asocial
                   alternative (for example, trial-andor learning) to
                   acquire adaptive behavior in a complex environment.
                   Most current theory predicts the emergence of mixed
                   strategies that rely on some combination of the two
                   types of learning. In the tournament, however,
                   strategies that relied heavily on social learning

                   because individuals frequently demonstrated the

                   increase the fitness of a population. We expand on

                   and social learning as well as incorporating a

                   and then by individual learning if socially acquired

                   Early life conditions provide a potential cue to the
                   reliability of social information later in life.
                   Here, we addressed whether direct early life
                   experience of the utility of social learning
                   influences later social learning propensities. We
                   reared guppy, Poecilia reticulata, fry for 45 days in
                   three different social conditions which involved the
                   presence of adult demonstrators providing cues about
                   feeding locations in the tanks (‘follow adults' and
                   ‘avoid adults' treatments), or their absence (‘no
                   adults' treatment). In the ‘follow adults'
                   treatment, juveniles that swam in the same direction
                   as the adult demonstrators found food, whereas in the
                   ‘avoid adults' treatment, subjects that swam in the
                   opposite direction to the demonstrators found food.
                   We then tested the fish with a social learning task,
                   to examine whether prior experience had influenced
                   the social learning tendencies of the juveniles.
                   After another 45 days of rearing under common-garden
                   conditions with no adult fish present in the tanks,
                   subjects were retested with the same social learning
                   task, to investigate whether early experiences had
                   effects persisting into adulthood. After 45 days of
                   rearing we found no evidence for social learning in
                   any of the experimental groups. However, after 90
                   days of rearing, we found evidence of social
                   learning, but only in the ‘follow adults'
                   treatment. These results suggest that social learning
                   propensities may develop over life, and that prior
                   exposure to conspecifics providing useful foraging
                   information during early life can shape the degree of
                   reliance on social learning in adulthood.},

                   towards conspecifics may lead to suboptimal foraging
                   performance because the presence of multiple

                   by conspecifics when they offered a lower reward than
                   unoccupied similar flowers. Bumblebees were able to
                   discriminate between poorly and highly rewarding
                   flowers by using the presence of a nonsocial cue (a

                   rewarding flowers were indicated by social cues

                   that is simply described, well-suited to controlled
                   laboratory study, and representative of a broad class
                   of real-world problems. In bandit problems, people
                   must choose between a set of alternatives, each with
                   different unknown reward rates, to maximize the total
                   reward they receive over a fixed number of trials. A
                   key feature of the task is that it challenges people
                   to balance the exploration of unfamiliar choices with
                   the exploitation of familiar ones. We use a Bayesian
                   model of optimal decision-making on the task, in
                   which how people balance exploration with
                   exploitation depends on their assumptions about the
                   distribution of reward rates. We also use Bayesian
                   model selection measures that assess how well people
                   adhere to an optimal decision process, compared to
                   simpler heuristic decision strategies. Using these
                   models, we make inferences about the decision-making
                   of 451 participants who completed a set of bandit
                   problems, and relate various measures of their
                   performance to other psychological variables,
                   including psychometric assessments of cognitive
                   abilities and personality traits. We find clear
                   evidence of individual differences in the way the
                   participants made decisions on the bandit problems,
                   and some interesting correlations with measures of

                   combines expertise from the diverse helds of computer
                   science and computational science to create a new
                   approach to numerical computing. Julia is designed to
                   be easy and fast and questions notions generally held
                   to be "laws of nature" by practitioners of numerical
                   computing: 1. High-level dynamic programs have to be
                   slow. 2. One must prototype in one language and then
                   rewrite in another language for speed or deployment.
                   3. There are parts of a system appropriate for the
                   programmer, and other parts that are best left
                   untouched as they have been built by the experts. We
                   introduce the Julia programming language and its
                   design-a dance between specialization and
                   abstraction. Specialization allows for custom
                   treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from
                   computer science, picks the right algorithm for the
                   right circumstance. Abstraction, which is what good
                   computation is really about, recognizes what remains
                   the same after differences are stripped away.
                   Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code
                   through another technique from computer science,
                   generic programming. Julia shows that one can achieve
                   machine performance without sacrificing human
                   convenience.},

                   autonomous agents interact with their environment and

                   an integral method for modeling and simulating
                   complex systems, such as socio-economic problems.
                   Since agent-based models are not described by simple
                   and concise mathematical equations, the code that
                   generates them is typically complicated, large, and
                   slow. Here we present Agents.jl, a Julia-based
                   software that provides an ABM analysis platform with
                   minimal code complexity. We compare our software with
                   some of the most popular ABM software in other

                   only the most performant but also the least

                   so on. This removes any “extensions library”

                   the relative strength of their conformist social
                   learning biases. Here we use both treatment effects
                   and individual variation to test predictions about
                   the impact of (1) the number of traits in an

                   those traits, (3) the fidelity of transmission, and

                   increase with the number of traits, the adaptive
                   value of those traits, and the fidelity of
                   transmission. The strength of conformist transmission
                   increases with group size, but only when there were 2
                   traits in the environment. Using individual-level
                   variation and recognizing that treatment effects
                   predictably impact individuals differently, we show
                   that IQ negatively predicts social learning, but has
                   a U-shaped relationship to conformist transmission,
                   suggesting strategic use of conformist-biased social
                   learning among those with the highest IQ. Other
                   plausible predictors, such as status, cultural
                   background, and personality, were not predictive.
                   Broadly, our results reveal that not only is the
                   conformist transmission bias ubiquitous, but that
                   past experiments, both human and non-human, have
                   likely underestimated its prevalence and the

  abstract =      {Choosing from whom to learn is an important element
                   of social learning. It affects learner success and
                   the profile of behaviors in the population. Because
                   individuals often differ in their traits and
                   capabilities, their benefits from different behaviors
                   may also vary. Homophily, or assortment, the tendency
                   of individuals to interact with other individuals
                   with similar traits, is known to affect the spread of
                   behaviors in humans. We introduce models to study the
                   evolution of assortative social learning (ASL), where
                   assorting on a trait acts as an individual-specific
                   mechanism for filtering relevant models from which to
                   learn when that trait varies. We show that when the
                   trait is polymorphic, ASL may maintain a stable
                   behavioral polymorphism within a population
                   (independently of coexistence with individual
                   learning in a population). We explore the evolution
                   of ASL when assortment is based on a nonheritable or
                   partially heritable trait, and when ASL competes with
                   different non-ASL strategies: oblique (learning from
                   the parental generation) and vertical (learning from
                   the parent). We suggest that the tendency to assort
                   may be advantageous in the context of social
                   learning, and that ASL might be an important concept
                   for the evolutionary theory of social learning.

  abstract =      {Reinforcement learning (RL) is based on the idea that
                   the tendency to produce an action should be
                   strengthened (reinforced) if it produces favourable
                   results, and weakened if it produces unfavourable
                   results. Q-learning is a recent RL algorithm that
                   does not need a model of its environment and can be
                   used on-line. Therefore, it is well suited for use in
                   repeated games against an unknown opponent. Most RL
                   research has been confined to single-agent settings
                   or to multiagent settings where the agents have
                   totally positively correlated payoffs (team problems)
                   or totally negatively correlated payoffs (zero-sum
                   games). This paper is an empirical study of
                   reinforcement learning in the Iterated Prisoner's
                   Dilemma (IPD), where the agents' payoffs are neither
                   totally positively nor totally negatively correlated.
                   RL is considerably more difficult in such a domain.
                   This paper investigates the ability of a variety of
                   Q-learning agents to play the IPD game against an
                   unknown opponent. In some experiments, the opponent
                   is the fixed strategy Tit-For-Tat, while in others it
                   is another Q-learner. All the Q-learners learned to
                   play optimally against Tit-For-Tat. Playing against
                   another learner was more difficult because the
                   adaptation of the other learner created a
                   non-stationary environment, and because the other
                   learner was not endowed with any a priori knowledge
                   about the IPD game such as a policy designed to
                   encourage cooperation. The learners that were studied
                   varied along three dimensions: the length of history
                   they received as context, the type of memory they
                   employed (look up tables based on restricted history
                   windows or recurrent neural networks that can
                   theoretically store features from arbitrarily deep in
                   the past), and the exploration schedule they
                   followed. Although all the learners faced
                   difficulties when playing against other learners,
                   agents with longer history windows, lookup table
                   memories, and longer exploration schedules fared best
                   in the IPD games.},

  abstract =      {Social learning is a key component of human and
                   animal intelligence. By taking cues from the behavior
                   of experts in their environment, social learners can
                   acquire sophisticated behavior and rapidly adapt to
                   new circumstances. This paper investigates whether
                   independent reinforcement learning (RL) agents in a
                   multi-agent environment can learn to use social
                   learning to improve their performance. We find that
                   in most circumstances, vanilla model-free RL agents
                   do not use social learning. We analyze the reasons
                   for this deficiency, and show that by imposing
                   constraints on the training environment and
                   introducing a model-based auxiliary loss we are able
                   to obtain generalized social learning policies which
                   enable agents to: i) discover complex skills that are
                   not learned from single-agent training, and ii) adapt
                   online to novel environments by taking cues from
                   experts present in the new environment. In contrast,
                   agents trained with model-free RL or imitation
                   learning generalize poorly and do not succeed in the
                   transfer tasks. By mixing multi-agent and solo
                   training, we can obtain agents that use social
                   learning to gain skills that they can deploy when
                   alone, even out-performing agents trained alone from
                   the start.},

  abstract =      {The advances in reinforcement learning have recorded
                   sublime success in various domains. Although the
                   multi-agent domain has been overshadowed by its
                   single-agent counterpart during this progress,
                   multi-agent reinforcement learning gains rapid
                   traction, and the latest accomplishments address
                   problems with real-world complexity. This article
                   provides an overview of the current developments in
                   the field of multi-agent deep reinforcement learning.
                   We focus primarily on literature from recent years
                   that combines deep reinforcement learning methods
                   with a multi-agent scenario. To survey the works that
                   constitute the contemporary landscape, the main
                   contents are divided into three parts. First, we
                   analyze the structure of training schemes that are
                   applied to train multiple agents. Second, we consider
                   the emergent patterns of agent behavior in
                   cooperative, competitive and mixed scenarios. Third,
                   we systematically enumerate challenges that
                   exclusively arise in the multi-agent domain and
                   review methods that are leveraged to cope with these
                   challenges. To conclude this survey, we discuss
                   advances, identify trends, and outline possible
                   directions for future work in this research area.},

  abstract =      {We propose a unified mechanism for achieving
                   coordination and communication in Multi-Agent
                   Reinforcement Learning (MARL), through rewarding
                   agents for having causal influence over other agents'
                   actions. Causal influence is assessed using
                   counterfactual reasoning. At each timestep, an agent
                   simulates alternate actions that it could have taken,
                   and computes their effect on the behavior of other
                   agents. Actions that lead to bigger changes in other
                   agents' behavior are considered influential and are
                   rewarded. We show that this is equivalent to
                   rewarding agents for having high mutual information
                   between their actions. Empirical results demonstrate
                   that influence leads to enhanced coordination and
                   communication in challenging social dilemma
                   environments, dramatically increasing the learning
                   curves of the deep RL agents, and leading to more
                   meaningful learned communication protocols. The
                   influence rewards for all agents can be computed in a
                   decentralized way by enabling agents to learn a model
                   of other agents using deep neural networks. In
                   contrast, key previous works on emergent
                   communication in the MARL setting were unable to
                   learn diverse policies in a decentralized manner and
                   had to resort to centralized training. Consequently,
                   the influence reward opens up a window of new
                   opportunities for research in this area.},

    abstract = { Social learning and life history interact in human adaptation, but nearly all models of the evolution of social learning omit age structure and population regulation. Further progress is hindered by a poor appreciation of how life history affects selection on learning. We discuss why life history and age structure are important for social learning and present an exemplary model of the evolution of social learning in which demographic properties of the population arise endogenously from assumptions about per capita vital rates and different forms of population regulation. We find that, counterintuitively, a stronger reliance on social learning is favoured in organisms characterized by ‘fast’ life histories with high mortality and fertility rates compared to ‘slower’ life histories typical of primates. Long lifespans make early investment in learning more profitable and increase the probability that the environment switches within generations. Both effects favour more individual learning. Additionally, under fertility regulation (as opposed to mortality regulation), more juveniles are born shortly after switches in the environment when many adults are not adapted, creating selection for more individual learning. To explain the empirical association between social learning and long life spans and to appreciate the implications for human evolution, we need further modelling frameworks allowing strategic learning and cumulative culture. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Life history and learning: how childhood, caregiving and old age shape cognition and culture in humans and other animals’. }
